1 -  //TODO: initialise the cells array using ROWS and COLS constants  ✓

2 -// TODO: Check whether the game has ended in a draw. ✓
	// Hint: Use a nested loop (see the constructor for an example). Check whether any of the cells content in the board grid are Player.Empty. If they are, it is not a draw.
	// Hint: Return false if it is not a draw, return true if there are no empty positions left
(Ran into an issue with the "Commit and Push" system so it pushed all failed commits {about 4-5} to the GITHUB link at once)

3 -  // TODO: Check if the player has 3 in the playerCol. ✓
          // Hint: Use the row code above as a starting point, remember that it goes cells[row][column] 

4 - // TODO: Check the diagonal in the other direction✓
