# BIT504_AT2_Task2
Programming I - Assessment 2


**Simple Update & Fixes**

- Changed colors of the Board

- Fixed the Draw issues, it no longer instantly draws as soon as Cross_Player places their first X.

- Added a green line to show the winning 3. No matter which direction they win in (Diagonal, horizontal or vertical)

- repaired issues with JDK files/complier, they no longer switch between 1.4 and JDK-19. Which in turn created more errors.
